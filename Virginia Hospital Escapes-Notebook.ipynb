    "If you ever spent a night at a hospital, either as a visitor or a staff member, you were probably grateful for any contact with the outside world. You might also have appreciated having venues nearby for food, prescriptions, flowers, or just a path with some fresh air. This report compares hospitals in the state of Virginia with respect to their surrounding venues, with the intent that your next hospital visit in Virginia is a little more freeing. \n",

    "This analysis draws upon location data obtained from Foursquare.com in order to explore the diversity of venues surrounding the 200-plus hospitals in Virginia. I will attempt to discover the ten most common venue types surrounding each hospital. I will also filter out hospitals with little or few options for nearby food, pharmacies, or nature walks. "

    "My first step was to obtain the hospital data. I performed a search of Virginia Hospitals on lat-long.com and got results in the form of a table that contained hospital name, feature type (hospital), county, and state. I was able to copy the table and paste it into an Excel spreadsheet. Latitutde and Longitude for each hospital were obtained one at a time and copied individually to new columns in the Excel spreadsheet. This was a manageable task given the size of my data (about 250 hospitals). Next I saved the spreadsheet and uploaded it to my jupyter notebook in IBM's Watson studio as a pandas dataframe."

That should be enough to provide some useful insights about the venues for escape near each hospital in Virginia. As we saw from the map, hospitals in Virginia are very spread out, with most hospitals clustered around areas of dense population. Let's narrow our focus to just the hospitals in Northern Virginia. Then let's get the nearest 100 venues for each hospital from Foursquare. I'll just drop the venue data above and start over with selecting only general hospitals in northern Virginia."

    "Before trying the easier method above, I tried this: I filtered 'nova_hospitals' above with one of the 'Distance Class' labels to retrieve a list of hospitals. I then filtered the 'nova_venues_no_h' dataframe according to those hospitals. I added the bin value column (using join) from 'min_venue_distances' using Hospital and Venue names as keys. Lastly, I filtered the dataframe for just those rows with the closest venues ('Distance Bin' = 10) to see what kinds of venues were represented. Look at the Category column in the output field below to see what kinds of venues are nearest to the hospitals in category 0 of my 'Distance Class' cluster. I opted out of using this method because it is so verbose - I cannot even see all of the venue categories represented."
